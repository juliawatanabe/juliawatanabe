## Hi there, I'm Julia 👋

Welcome to my space. 🌻

### About me 🍃

I'm a non binary person from Brazil interested in game and web development. 

Currently I'm studying fullstack development as a self-taught, but I hope to start a degree on IT field soon. 

I really like to learn new topics, so this journey has been really fun and fulfilling.

My favorite game genres are farming simulator, JRPG, horror and visual novel/dating sim. 

- 😄 Pronouns: they/them.
- 💬 I can speak **english** and **portuguese** and I can understand a bit of written spanish.
